# Heart-Disease-Classifier

This repository contains the code and resources for the Heart Disease Classifier project, which aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an accurate and reliable classifier model that can assist in the early detection and management of heart disease. The dataset used for this project combines multiple heart disease datasets, resulting in a comprehensive dataset with 11 common features. The project utilizes classification models from the scikit-learn library, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Project Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained classifier models for future use.
- `reports/`: This directory contains the evaluation reports, including classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python libraries and dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the results, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd heart-disease-classifier`
3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended): `python3 -m venv env` and activate it using `source env/bin/activate` (Unix) or `env\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
6. Open the desired notebook from the `notebooks/` directory and execute the cells to run the code.

Note: Before running the notebooks, ensure that the dataset file is placed in the `data/` directory.

## Evaluation and Results
The project evaluates the performance of each classifier model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are stored in the `reports/` directory, including classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance analysis.

## Conclusion
The Heart Disease Classifier project demonstrates the application of scikit-learn's classification models to predict heart disease based on medical attributes. The developed models can assist in early detection and management of heart disease, potentially contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.
